# Business-Name-Generator
I was trying to come up with an original name for a business, and decided to try and create an app to help.  
Most business name generators I found used existing words, and I wanted something completely unique.  
It has turned into a much larger project than I intended!

The class "Item" was designed so that each letter, digraph, and trigraph is weighted and can hold properties 
that should eventually help the program decide what letters go well together.  

It is starting to generate better sounding names now, but it still has a way to go.  Any help is appreciated!
I am still pretty new to coding.
